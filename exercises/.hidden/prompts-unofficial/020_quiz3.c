 Let's see if we can make use of some of the things we've learned so far.
 We'll create two functions: one that contains a "for" loop and one
 that contains a "while" loop.
 Both of these are simply labeled "loop" below.
 You won't see this every day: a function that takes an array with
 exactly four u16 numbers. This is not how you would normally pass
 an array to a function. We'll learn about slices and pointers in
 a little while. For now, we're using what we know.
 This function prints, but does not return anything.
 This function bears a striking resemblance to twoToThe() in the last
 exercise. But don't be fooled! This one does the math without the aid
 of the standard library!
