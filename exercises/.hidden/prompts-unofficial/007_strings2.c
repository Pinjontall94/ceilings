 Here's a fun one: Zig has multi-line strings!
 To make a multi-line string, put '\\' at the beginning of each
 line just like a code comment but with backslashes instead:
     const two_lines =
         \\Line One
         \\Line Two
     ;
 See if you can make this program print some song lyrics.
