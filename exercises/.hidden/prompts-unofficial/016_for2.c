 For loops also let you use the "index" of the iteration, a number
 that counts up with each iteration. To access the index of iteration,
 specify a second condition as well as a second capture value.
     for (items, 0..) |item, index| {
         // Do something with item and index
     }
 You can name "item" and "index" anything you want. "i" is a popular
 shortening of "index". The item name is often the singular form of
 the items you're looping through.
 As mentioned in the previous exercise, 'for' loops have gained
 additional flexibility since these early exercises were
 written. As we'll see in later exercises, the above syntax for
 capturing the index is part of a more general ability. Hang in
 there!
