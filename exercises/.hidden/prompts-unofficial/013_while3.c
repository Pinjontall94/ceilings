 The last two exercises were functionally identical. Continue
 expressions really show their utility when used with 'continue'
 statements!
 Example:
     while (condition) : (continue expression) {
         if (other condition) continue;
     }
 The "continue expression" executes every time the loop restarts
 whether the "continue" statement happens or not.
