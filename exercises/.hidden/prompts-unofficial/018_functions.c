 Functions! We've already created lots of functions called 'main()'. Now let's
 do something different:
     fn foo(n: u8) u8 {
         return n + 1;
     }
 The foo() function above takes a number 'n' and returns a number that is
 larger by one.
 Note the input parameter 'n' and return types are both u8.
 Please define the deepThought() function below.
 We're just missing a couple things. One thing we're NOT missing is the
 keyword "pub", which is not needed here. Can you guess why?
