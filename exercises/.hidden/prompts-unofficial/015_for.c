 Behold the 'for' loop! For loops let you execute code for each
 element of an array:
     for (items) |item| {
         // Do something with item
     }
 Note that 'for' loops also work on things called "slices"
 which we'll see later.
 Also note that 'for' loops have recently become more flexible
 and powerful (two years after this exercise was written).
 More about that in a moment.
