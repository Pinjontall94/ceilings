 Zig 'while' statements create a loop that runs while the
 condition is true. This runs once (at most):
     while (condition) {
         condition = false;
     }
 Remember that the condition must be a boolean value and
 that we can get a boolean value from conditional operators
 such as:
     a == b   means "a equals b"
     a < b    means "a is less than b"
     a > b    means "a is greater than b"
     a != b   means "a does not equal b"
