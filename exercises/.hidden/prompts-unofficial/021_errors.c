================================================================================

 Believe it or not, sometimes things go wrong in programs.
 In Zig, an error is a value. Errors are named so we can identify
 things that can go wrong. Errors are created in "error sets", which
 are just a collection of named errors.
 We have the start of an error set, but we're missing the condition
 "TooSmall". Please add it where needed!
 Notice how this function can return any member of the MyNumberError
 error set.
