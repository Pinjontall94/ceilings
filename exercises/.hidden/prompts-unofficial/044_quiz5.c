    "Elephants walking
     Along the trails
     Are holding hands
     By holding tails."
     from Holding Hands
       by Lenore M. Link
 This function visits all elephants once, starting with the
 first elephant and following the tails to the next elephant.
 If we did not "mark" the elephants as visited (by setting
 visited=true), then this would loop infinitely!
