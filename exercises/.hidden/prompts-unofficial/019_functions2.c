 Now let's create a function that takes a parameter. Here's an
 example that takes two parameters. As you can see, parameters
 are declared just like any other types ("name": "type"):
     fn myFunction(number: u8, is_lucky: bool) {
         ...
     }
 Please give this function the correct input parameter(s).
 You'll need to figure out the parameter name and type that we're
 expecting. The output type has already been specified for you.
