# Notes

## Structure
What follows is my problemwise notes as I progress through ziglings, summarizing
for each challenge what the equivalent in C would be.

Each subheading will describe in brief what the challenge is and should be, if
directly applicable to C. Failing that, the subheading will be the zig challenge
and subsequent notes underneath will pertain to C implementation particularities

Challenges not applicable to C with any reasonable amount of effort will be
either be denoted N/A or designated an alternate challenge proposal.

## Exercises

### 1. Public Function
Make a failing build of a public function work as such (req'd in zig, but not C).
Could have a small project that exports a greeter?
