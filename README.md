# ceilings

A code-along project in C in the vein of 
[rustlings](https://rustlings.cool) and especially 
[ziglings](https://ziglings.org).

## NOTE
This project is very much a WIP and quite transparently indebted to the
ziglings project, which I'm following along with as I learn both languages. Let
it be clear that the files in `exercises/.hidden` and are in no way my code,
and serve solely as a point of comparison while I work to translate relevant
zig challenges into C ones. (Of course, not all will even port in the first
place, i.e. comptime and anonymous structs sections). This project wouldn't
exist without ziglings and in no way do I take credit for their work.
